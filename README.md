# cryptography-rs

This repository defines Rust crates in the cryptography space. The
crates in this repo were generally born out of a desire to support other
projects from the author, such as implementing Rust code signing in pure
Rust.

The original/primary author is not an expert in the cryptography space and
crates in this repository have not undergone extensive security audits unless
stated otherwise. Caution/restraint should be exercised before using these
crates in a security-sensitive context.
